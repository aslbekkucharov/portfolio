                I'm a dedicated frontend developer with a growing passion for backend technologies, currently diving deep into Node.js (Nest.js) to broaden my skillset. With hands-on experience in modern frameworks like React and Vue, I craft intuitive, high-quality user interfaces that prioritize both performance and design. Outside of coding, I'm an avid mountain hiker and extreme sports enthusiast, which fuels my attention to detail and problem-solving mindset.
